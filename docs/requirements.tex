\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Begin Section

This section of the SRS should provide an overview of the entire SRS.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
	
	This document will describe what our product intends to accomplish, what its assumptions 
	are, and what it relies on. Anyone with a non-technical background will still be able to read
	and understand  how the application will work on a higher level after reading this requirements
	specification document.
	
% End SubSection

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item \textbf{Cabpool} shall be an \textbf{android application} produced for an unidentified taxi company to be used in conjunction with their \textbf{Dispatcher} system with the aim of increasing the volume of taxi users.  
	\item The software shall provide a platform for taxi users to carpool and reduce individual fare cost without requiring the sharing of personal contact information.
	\item The software shall provide the user with \textbf{Offer Taxi Mode} and \textbf{Request Taxi Mode}. Within each mode the user shall be able to accept or reject any search result based on distance, rating and fare price.
	\item The software shall serve as a social networking device to connect users who want to travel to similar locations. As well, the user of the software shall be able to invite fellow users to their \textbf{friends list} and share contact information with one another. Conversely, users will be able to add other users to a \textbf{blacklist} to ensure they never share a cab with that user again. 
	\item The software shall not provide personal information without express permission in accordance with the Ontario Freedom of Information and Privacy Act and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act. 
	\item The software will interface with \textbf{Google Maps} to enable users to view their route and potential route changes.
	\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}
\label{sub:definitions_acronyms_and_abbreviations}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the SRS
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{References}
\label{sub:references}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS
	\item Identify each document by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization
	\item Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
% Begin SubSection
The remaining sections of this document provide a general description, including characteristics of the users of this application. It also includes the product's features, functional and non-functional requirements of the Application.  General description of the project is discussed in section 2 of this document.  Section 3 gives the functional requirements such as constraints and assumptions made while designing the application.  It also gives the user viewpoint of product.  Section 3 also gives the specific requirements of the product. Section 4 give the non-functional requirements of the application. This section discusses the external interface requirements and gives detailed description of functional requirements.
% End SubSection

% End Section

\section{Overall Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

This section of the SRS should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. It does not state specific requirements; it provides a background for those requirements and makes them easier to understand.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection
Two notably similar applications already exist in the Google Play store, however, there are some key
differences between those products and ours. One of the existing applications only attempts to make it easier for friends or strangers to carpool with their personal vehicles, not using a taxi service. The second product uses a taxi service, but customers who share a taxi must be picked up, and dropped off at the same destination. Our product uses a taxi service, thus eliminating risk of illegal activities that may occur when carpooling with a stranger, and does not limit carpoolers to having the exact same pick-up and destination locations.\\

Our application is intended to be used as 
a sub-component of the taxi company dispatching system. The company dispatching system requires 
filling any taxi requests. Our application will allow users to offer a taxi up for sharing. 
When this happens, the dispatching system will be notified of a taxi that may be able to fill
another taxi request. Information such as the taxi's current location, and destination will be passed. Users are also able to request a shared taxi. When this request is filed, the dispatching system is again notified, so it may try to match a shared taxi offer with a shared taxi request. Matches will only be made if the users will save money choosing to share, as opposed to 
requesting a new taxi, and not sharing. If a match or more is made, the user who initiated the request may view what taxi's they may take in order to save money. Information about each taxi
ride will be shown to the user. The user may then submit a final request for the specific taxi
chosen in the viewable list. The user that offered that taxi will be notified of a potential
carpooler, and will have the choice to accept or decline the request.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item The \textbf{application} will enable users to create a profile and enter two modes, \textbf{Request Taxi Carpool} and \textbf{Offer Taxi Carpool}. In the \textbf{Offer Taxi Carpool} mode the user will scan a barcode within the taxi which will contain taxi identification information to be sent to the \textbf{Dispatcher}. In each mode the user will be able to enter their destination and sort their search results by distance, ratings and fare price. 
	
	\item The user will be able to enter constraint criteria such as preferred sex and maximum number of passengers. When a match is selected a request is sent to the \textbf{Dispatcher} which will relay the request for confirmation from the potential match. 
	
	\item The \textbf{Dispatcher} will store all taxi and user information to enable users to connect with one another, sharing taxis and reducing fares without releasing personal information to strangers. The \textbf{application} will ensure that all messages will retain confidentiality and integrity.
	
	\item The \textbf{application} will display the fare owed by each customer and allow rating of customers with whom the ride was shared. Additionally, customers will be able to add other riders to a \textbf{friends list} or a \textbf{blacklist}.
	
	\item The \textbf{application} will enable customers to view their route on Google Maps, as well as any potential route changes.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sub:user_characteristics}
% Begin SubSection
We expect two different type users using this application: the user requesting a taxi, and the user offering a taxi.
\\
\bigskip
The user must to be over the age of eighteen for legal reasons. The user is expected to be English literate and be able to navigate through an application. The application will have options to input personal information, destinations, schedules, etc. Therefore the user must be capable of understanding what the application is doing.
\\
\bigskip
The user will not be expected to have technical expertise or high education, as the application will be built to be user friendly to the general public. Since the expected users will be carpooling many times, the user is encouraged to be social to make rides more pleasant for both type of users. 
% End SubSection

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sub:constraints}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer's options
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
% Begin SubSection
One assumption that the SRS makes is that the software does not need to provide directions for the driver of the taxi. If it is necessary that the taxi driver should receive directions to customers the SRS will have to be modified. A second assumption is that the Android operating system will be available on the hardware for which the software is designed. A third assumption is that the taxi company has a regular method of sending out taxis in addition to the sharing service. If the app is to be the only way to call a cab the SRS will need to be modified with this in mind. 
% End SubSection

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
\label{sub:apportioning_of_requirements}
% Begin SubSection
Requirements pertaining to capacity , size, and speed will not be considered for this version of the system but may need to be considered if the system is to work with large volumes of consumers in latter versions.
