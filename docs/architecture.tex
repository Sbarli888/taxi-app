\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection  
The purpose of this document is to identify and analyse the major components of the system. This document will describe use case scenarios of the system, decomposition of the system into classes and their categorization, the architecture of the system and responsibilities of the classes. This document was created for software engineers, developers and management. These users shall be able to read and understand how the Application will work on a higher level after reading this document.
% End SubSection

\subsection{System Description}
\label{sub:system_description}
% Begin SubSection

Cabpool will be an Android Application created for a Hamilton taxi company to be used in conjunction with their Dispatcher system with the aim of attracting customers by implementing a system that allows users to share taxis. The software will serve as a social networking service to connect users who want to travel to similar locations. The software will provide a platform for users to share taxis and reduce individual fare cost without having to share personal contact information. The software will allow the User to enter a taxi and scan the taxi QR code to offer the taxi and will also allow a User to request a taxi. When offering or requesting a taxi the User can accept or reject a taxi share match based on distance, rating and fare price. \newline
\newline
Additionally, the User of the software shall be able to add users to their Friends List and share contact information with one another. Conversely, users will be able to add other users to a Blacklist to ensure they never share a cab with that User again. The User can also manage their own Favourite Locations List. If a User is travelling to a location on another user's Favourite Locations List, and wants to offer to share their taxi, the system can notify the user(s) outside the cab if they would like to join. The software will interface with Google Maps to enable users to view their route and potential route changes. The software shall not allow third party interception of personal information nor shall it allow release of personal information to unauthorized Users.

\subsection{Login}
% Begin SubSection
A user enters their username and password in the login screen. The system verifies with the Dispatcher that the username/password pair exists in the user records database, then it displays the main menu. If the username/password pair does not exist an error message on the login screen will notify the user that they have input incorrect information and allow them to try again. 
% End SubSection
\subsection{Register}
% Begin SubSection
A user enters their desired username and password, date of birth, sex, and phone number in the register screen. The system verifies with the Dispatcher that the username is appropriate and that the phone number is in the correct format.

% End SubSection
\subsection{View Incoming Request}
% Begin SubSection
A user is notified of an incoming request from the Dispatcher in the offer taxi screen once another user has accepted their offer. While the app is running, the system will notify the user of all incoming requests. The app can be minimized and/or the user does not need to be on the offer taxi screen to receive notification of the request to share the taxi. 
% End SubSection
\subsection{Accept User}
% Begin SubSection
On the offer taxi screen, a user accepts a taxi share request another user has made. The system requests the Dispatcher retrieve the requesting user's location. The system then displays the requesting user location in the offer taxi screen. The system requires the Dispatcher to notify the requesting user that their request has been accepted.  
% End SubSection
\subsection{Decline User}
% Begin SubSection
On the offer taxi screen, a user declines a taxi share request another user has made. The system will require the Dispatcher to notify the requesting user that their request has been declined. The system will require the Dispatcher to update the offer in the offers database so that it no longer displays to the declined user.
% End SubSection
\subsection{Request Taxi}
% Begin SubSection
A user enters their start location, start time, and arrival destination in the request taxi screen. The system will request for the Dispatcher to retrieve all relevant offers from the offers database and display them in the request taxi screen. 
% End SubSection

\section{Architectural Design}
\label{sec:architectural_design}
% Begin Section

\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection
    
Overall, the system exhibits a Client-Server based architecture. A Client-Server architecture allows for clean implementation of many-to-one relationships, as our system exhibits through the many users to one dispatcher. The many-to-one relationship is neccessary for the system because the many users need to be connected to a common data source in order for their mobile applications to reflect and impact the state of the system at any given time. This is important because ultimately the users are not just connecting to the system, but rather, they are connecting to other users through the system. 
\newline
\newline
Upon closer inspection of the subsystems, it is apparent that the Client-side is designed using a Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. The user interacts with the different screens (the View) to elicit a response from the system (the Controller), which facilitates updates to the database (the Model) via the Dispatcher.
\\

% End SubSection

\subsection{Subsystems}
\label{sub:subsystems}
% Begin SubSection
The system is a composition of five subsystems, the View, the ViewController, the Dispatcher, the DataController and the Datastore. The first subsystem is the View, which receives user input and displays system output. Input received by the View is sent to the ViewContoller subsystem, which is responsible for minor processing and passing the data to the Dispatcher subsystem. The Dispatcher subsystem is responsible for establishing a line of connection between the User and the Server in the Client-Server architecture. The Dispatcher receives data from the ViewController and sends it to the DataController which does the major processing of the system. The DataController subsystem receives data from the Dispatcher subsystem and takes data from the Datastore subsystem and the runs calculations to determine the output that will be sent back to the user through the Controller, and display in the View.
