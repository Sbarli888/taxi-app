\section{Testing}
\label{sec:testing}
% Begin Section
Performance of the application is smooth and seamless on an android phone, there are no actions that take a noticeably long time to register, the application launches quickly and interfaces well with Google Maps. We decided that black-box testing was sufficient for asserting the correct behaviour with respect to the requirements. Due to the nature of our application, testing the code itself (white-box testing) was not deemed necessary. All user interaction with the application is done through a UI and is very restricted. As seen in the following figure, with the exception of innovative features, all requirements were met. The application catches exception cases and displays appropriate error messages, hence we have determined our implementation to be successful. Our application is effective and bug free, having met all base requirements we are confident with additional time innovative features could easily be added to fulfill additional nonfunctional requirements.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{requirements}

\subsection{Register}
%Begin SubSection

\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,height=.5\textheight,keepaspectratio]{scanqrcodefailure}
\newline
Within the option to offer a taxi the user must first scan the taxi QR code, to start this process they must select Scan Code. The app will then require them to complete the scanning process. When an invalid code is scanned then an error message is displayed indicating the code is invalid. Following a successful scan the scan code screen indicates the code was scanned and the user must submit it to verify offer. The server will update to indicate the user has entered the taxi associated with the scanned QR code. 
%End SubSection

\subsection{Cancel Offer}
%Begin SubSection
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,height=.5\textheight,keepaspectratio]{offer_removed}

%End SubSection

\subsection{View Incoming Request}
%Begin SubSection
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,height=.5\textheight,keepaspectratio]{viewincomingrequests}

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}
% Begin Section
The application runs smoothly on an android phone and interfaces well with Google Maps. Communication with the server is quick and secure. Barcode scanning is quick and effective. Desired user features work well and the application runs as expected. With the exception of innovative features, all requirements were met. Exception cases display appropriate error messages and the user is prompted on how to correct their behavior to achieve desired results. Our application is successful and we are confident it is free of bugs. 

\smallskip
At present, the innovative features proposed, including Friends List, Blacklist, and Favourite Locations are not functional. While the options appear in the app selection of these does not provide the desired functionality and this an area requiring future work.

\smallskip
Future Work for this project involves scaling the application to handle a larger user base. Currently the server will not accommodate greater than 30 users, in the future, this limit will be unacceptable and must be increased to reflect the vast number of users anticipated to use this application.
